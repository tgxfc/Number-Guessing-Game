# Number Guessing Game
This is a simple console-based number guessing game written in C++.  

A random number ranging from 0 to 999 is generated and you have 10 turns to guess what number it is.
There is a score system in place, for each time you guess the number a certain amount of points is added, and for each time you miss the number a certain amount is deduced.
